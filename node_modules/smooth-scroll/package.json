[Getting Started](#getting-started)\n2. [Installing with Package Managers](#installing-with-package-managers)\n3. [Working with the Source Files](#working-with-the-source-files)\n4. [Options & Settings](#options-and-settings)\n5. [Browser Compatibility](#browser-compatibility)\n6. [Known Issues](#known-issues)\n7. [Contributors](#contributors)\n8. [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)\n9. [License](#license)\n10. [Changelog](#changelog)\n11. [Older Docs](#older-docs)\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCompiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code. Unit tests are located in the `test` directory.\n\n### 1. Include Smooth Scroll on your site.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"dist/js/smooth-scroll.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### 2. Add the markup to your HTML.\n\n```html\n<a data-scroll href=\"#bazinga\">Anchor Link</a>\n...\n<span id=\"bazinga\">Bazinga!</span>\n```\n\nTurn anchor links into Smooth Scroll links by adding the `[data-scroll]` data attribute. Give the anchor location an ID just like you normally would.\n\n### 3. Initialize Smooth Scroll.\n\n```html\n<script>\n\tsmoothScroll.init();\n</script>\n```\n\nIn the footer of your page, after the content, initialize Smooth Scroll. And that's it, you're done. Nice work!\n\n\n\n## Installing with Package Managers\n\nYou can install Smooth Scroll with your favorite package manager.\n\n* **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):** `npm install cferdinandi/smooth-scroll`\n* **[Bower](http://bower.io/):** `bower install https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll.git`\n* **[Component](http://component.io/):** `component install cferdinandi/smooth-scroll`\n\n\n\n## Working with the Source Files\n\nIf you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](http://gulpjs.com/). This compiles, lints, and minifies code, and runs unit tests. It's the same build system that's used by [Kraken](http://cferdinandi.github.io/kraken/), so it includes some unnecessary tasks and Sass variables but can be dropped right in to the boilerplate without any configuration.\n\n### Dependencies\nMake sure these are installed first.\n\n* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)\n* [Ruby Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)\n* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.\n2. Run `npm install` to install required files.\n3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:\n\t* `gulp` manually compiles files.\n\t* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files when changes are made.\n\t* `gulp reload` automatically compiles files and applies changes using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).\n\n\n\n## Options and Settings\n\nSmooth Scroll includes smart defaults and works right out of the box. But if you want to customize things, it also has a robust API that provides multiple ways for you to adjust the default options and settings.\n\n### Global Settings\n\nYou can pass options and callbacks into Smooth Scroll through the `init()` function:\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.init({\n\tspeed: 500, // Integer. How fast to complete the scroll in milliseconds\n\teasing: 'easeInOutCubic', // Easing pattern to use\n\tupdateURL: true, // Boolean. Whether or not to update the URL with the anchor hash on scroll\n\toffset: 0, // Integer. How far to offset the scrolling anchor location in pixels\n\tcallbackBefore: function ( toggle, anchor ) {}, // Function to run before scrolling\n\tcallbackAfter: function ( toggle, anchor ) {} // Function to run after scrolling\n});\n```\n\n#### Easing Options\n\n**Linear**\n*Moves at the same speed from start to finish.*\n\n* `Linear`\n\n\n**Ease-In**\n*Gradually increases in speed.*\n\n* `easeInQuad`\n* `easeInCubic`\n* `easeInQuart`\n* `easeInQuint`\n\n\n**Ease-In-Out**\n*Gradually increases in speed, peaks, and then gradually slows down.*\n\n* `easeInOutQuad`\n* `easeInOutCubic`\n* `easeInOutQuart`\n* `easeInOutQuint`\n\n\n**Ease-Out**\n*Gradually decreases in speed.*\n\n* `easeOutQuad`\n* `easeOutCubic`\n* `easeOutQuart`\n* `easeOutQuint`\n\n\nLearn more about the different easing patterns and what they do at [easings.net](http://easings.net/).\n\n### Override settings with data attributes\n\nSmooth Scroll also lets you override global settings on a link-by-link basis using the `[data-options]` data attribute:\n\n```html\n<a data-scroll\n   data-options='{\n                \t\"speed\": 500,\n                \t\"easing\": \"easeInOutCubic\",\n                \t\"offset\": 0,\n                \t\"updateURL\": false\n                }'\n>\n\tAnchor Link\n</a>\n```\n\n**Note:** You must use [valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com/) in order for the `data-options` feature to work.\n\n### Use Smooth Scroll events in your own scripts\n\nYou can also call Smooth Scroll's scroll animation events in your own scripts.\n\n#### animateScroll()\nAnimate scrolling to an anchor.\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll(\n\ttoggle, // Node that toggles the animation. ex. document.querySelector('#toggle')\n\tanchor, // ID of the anchor to scroll to. ex. '#bazinga'\n\toptions // Classes and callbacks. Same options as those passed into the init() function.\n);\n```\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll( null, '#bazinga' );\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```javascript\nvar toggle = document.querySelector('#toggle');\nvar options = { speed: 1000, easing: 'easeOutCubic' };\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll( toggle, '#bazinga', options );\n```\n\n#### destroy()\nDestroy the current `smoothScroll.init()`. This is called automatically during the `init` function to remove any existing initializations.\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.destroy();\n```\n\n\n### Fixed Headers\n\nAdd a `[data-scroll-header]` data attribute to fixed headers. Smooth Scroll will automatically offset scroll distances by the header height. If you have multiple fixed headers, add `[data-scroll-header]` to the last one in the markup.\n\n```html\n<nav data-scroll-header>\n\t...\n</nav>\n```\n\n\n## Browser Compatibility\n\nSmooth Scroll works in all modern browsers, and IE 9 and above.\n\nSmooth Scroll is built with modern JavaScript APIs, and uses progressive enhancement. If the JavaScript file fails to load, or if your site is viewed on older and less capable browsers, anchor links will jump the way they normally would. If you need to smooth scrolling for older browsers, [download the jQuery version of Smooth Scroll on GitHub](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll/tree/archive-v1).\n\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\nIf the `<body>` element has been assigned a height of `100%`, Smooth Scroll is unable to properly calculate page distances and will not scroll to the right location. The `<body>` element can have a fixed, non-percentage based height (ex. `500px`), or a height of `auto`.\n\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n* Easing support contributed by [Willem Liu](https://github.com/willemliu).\n* Easing functions forked from [Gaëtan Renaudeau](https://gist.github.com/gre/1650294).\n* URL history support contributed by [Robert Pate](https://github.com/robertpateii).\n* Fixed header support contributed by [Arndt von Lucadou](https://github.com/a-v-l).\n* Infinite loop bugs in iOS and Chrome (when zoomed) by [Alex Guzman](https://github.com/alexguzman).\n* IE10 rounding error fixed by [Luke Siedle](https://github.com/luke-siedle).\n* Enhanced callback functions by [Constant Meiring](https://github.com/constantm).\n* Scroll-to-top bug for links at the bottom of the page by [Jonas Havers](https://github.com/JonasHavers).\n* AMD support and numerous code improvements by [Todd Motto](https://github.com/toddmotto).\n* Push State bug fix by [Yanick Witschi](https://github.com/Toflar).\n* CommonJS module support by [Riku Rouvila](https://github.com/rikukissa).\n\n\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nIn lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
